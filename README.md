About

This repo contains my favorite vim colorschemes. Feel free to take any if you like but don't push back, most probably I won't like your favorite colorscheme.

Installation
------------

Add to .vimrc:

    Bundle 'javier-lopez/colors.vim'

And install it with:

    :BundleInstall

I'm a slave to aesthetics. If you are too, I hope this helps.
